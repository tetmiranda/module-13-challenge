# Background

![module-13-challenge](Images/mod13-background.JPG)

You work as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a fictitious venture capital firm. The Alphabet Soup business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked you to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will become successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The team has given you a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organisations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. This file contains various types of information about the organisations, including whether they ultimately became successful. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become successful.

# What You're Creating
To predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful, you will create a binary classification model using a deep neural network.

This challenge consists of three technical deliverables. You will do the following:

Preprocess data for a neural network model.

Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

Optimise the model.

# Instructions
The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

* Prepare the Data for Use on a Neural Network Model
* Compile and Evaluate a Binary Classification Model by Using a Neural Network
* Optimise the Neural Network Model
